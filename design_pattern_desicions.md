### Use mappings whenever possible (cheaper storage and faster to execute)

For example:
- https://github.com/hebusnimbus/Amazys/blob/master/contracts/MarketPlace.sol#L18
- https://github.com/hebusnimbus/Amazys/blob/master/contracts/MarketPlace.sol#L21


### Separate logical units in their own contracts (easier to read code and avoid bugs)

- Followed object oriented approach (Store, Product, MarketPlace)
